          <p>The Distributed Web of Care presents a skillshare series called <strong>Peers in Practice.</strong> This series invites the artists in residence at the Ace Hotel to investigate the distribution of power, autonomy and control.</p>

<p>Through an intimate interactive event, participants and artists will develop a dialog related to their practices by performing acts of collective caring, discussion and documentation.
As a participant in the skillshare, all we require is an open mind and desire to share together. We will be experimenting with different modes of documentation throughout the events. <strong>We will also send out a small set of readings and ask you to generate a few questions based on those readings so we can come together with an informed baseline.</strong></p>

<p>There will be four skillshares held between July 1st and July 22nd, culminating in a vibrant party in July 29th where the fellows and stewards from the Distributed Web of Care project will present their work on both tools and theory on a web of care, not control. Space is limited for the skillshare event. Please <a href="https://airtable.com/shrnr16Oq6oalF1S1">RSVP here</a>.</p>

<p>The skillshare will also include the following short workshops presented by stewards of the DWC project:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.laiyiohlsen.com/"><strong>Lai Yi Ohlsen</strong></a></p>

<p>Peer to peer protocols require trust and the negotiation of shared resources - so does the dance floor. Webs of moving bodies and sound are an ideal environment to understand how we can, and already do, prioritize care over control within a system. With a good enough groove, peers work together without ever skipping a beat. ‘100 Scores’ by Lai Yi Ohlsen is a repository of improvisational movement scores based upon computer science algorithms. For DWC she will present scores related to the potential of the distributed, peer to peer web.</p>

<p><a href="http://julianacastro.co/"><strong>Juliana Castro</strong></a></p>

<p>Meme culture and fast-paced social networking have encouraged the use of copyrighted resources without proper attribution. This talk will highlight the benefits of open-access, show a selection of available public domain and Creative Commons archives, and address best practices and fair use uses of institutional repositories and other people’s work.</p>

<p><a href="http://zachcoble.com/"><strong>Zach Coble</strong></a></p>

<p>Participants will engage in a conversation about gathering and using data from the web for social good. The steward will briefly show recent projects and we will use these examples to create a dialog about the legal and ethical issues involved in such projects.</p>
