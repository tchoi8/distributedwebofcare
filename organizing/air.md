We are excited to curate a wonderful group of artists for the [Ace Hotel](http://www.acehotel.com/newyork) Artists in Residence (AIR) in July 2018. The group of AIR are writers, artists, organizers and activists. Their practice are an inspiration for Distributed Web of Care. AIR will stay one night at the NYC hotel and produce work that will be shared via Ace Hotel's media channels. 

From Ace Hotel website
"This July, our Artists in Residence are curated by Taeyoon Workshop, whose Distributed Web of Care (DWC) research initiative explores the Distributed Web as a peer-to-peer, alternative web which prioritizes collective agency and individual ownership of data and code. Through collaborations with artists, engineers, social scientists and community organizers, DWC imagines distributed networks as a form of interdependence and stewardship, in critical opposition to the networks that dominate the world today. Taeyoon Choi is an artist and cofounder of School for Poetic Computation and a fellow at Data and Society."
