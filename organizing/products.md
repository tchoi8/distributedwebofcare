Care shirts and hoodies are fundraising for The Distributed Web of Care. All sales profit made through purchased merchandise will go directly towards supporting the Distributed Web of Care initiative and fellowship. The project explores Distributed Web as a peer-to-peer alternative web that prioritizes collective agency and individual ownership of data and code. The project asks us to unlearn the assumption that technological innovation and automation is an inherent good, asking instead how we can code to care and code carefully.
