## Introduction

As we are wrapping up the summer Skillshare series for the Distributed Web of Care project, we decided to write small letters to the artists and thinkers who presented at the series. This letters are published and shared on the distributed web and are compiled in the format of a zine. Some pages belong to the participants of the Skillshares and they are the only ones with the ability to edit, update, or delete those pages.

Letters to:

[Ari](dat://)

[Mindy](dat://)

[Jess and Shannon](dat://fa0e41a2ae5b518c41a02c62984ad5ed3697d57151f70a50616bdffe4591ea14/)
