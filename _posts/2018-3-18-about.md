Distributed Web of Care (DWC) is an initiative of [Taeyoon Workshop](http://taeyoonchoi.com/) based in New York City. Taeyoon Choi is an artist and cofounder of [School for Poetic Computation](http://sfpc.io/) and a 2017 - 2018 fellow at [Data and Society](https://datasociety.net/people/choi-taeyoon/). Currently there is an open call for **Fellows** to develop the tools and events, with **Stewards** who activate and expand them.  

As Taeyoon Choi writes in [“Artificial Advancement”](https://thenewinquiry.com/artificial-advancements/) for *The New Inquiry*, “Care, in contrast to cure, is a form of stewardship between people who support each other in communication, action, and social engagement. It is actualized by extending one’s mindfulness of another person’s dignity and feelings, while respecting their independence.” More projects on [Soft Care](http://taeyoonchoi.com/soft-care/).

The first DWC event took place in March as a part of Rhizome’s [Ethics & Archiving the Web](https://eaw.rhizome.org/) conference at the New Museum, NYC. The workshop offered resources for getting started with the Distributed Web, and invited computer scientists and domain experts to host an open conversation on counter-narratives to the mainstream internet. A transcript of this workshop is published on [this site](http://dwc-tchoi8.hashbase.io).
